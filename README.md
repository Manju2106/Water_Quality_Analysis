Project Title: Water Quality Analysis using IBM Cognos

Description:
Our project focuses on utilizing IBM Cognos, a powerful business intelligence and data analytics tool, to enhance water quality analysis. By integrating data from various sources such as sensors, lab reports, and historical records, we aim to provide real-time insights into water quality parameters. This includes monitoring key indicators like pH levels, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and pollutant concentrations. Through interactive dashboards and reporting, stakeholders can make informed decisions to ensure the safety and sustainability of our water resources. This project aligns with our commitment to environmental stewardship and data-driven decision-making.
